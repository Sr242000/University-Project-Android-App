Project Name - Design and Development of Edutech Android Application for Children with Dyslexia

I developed an Android app to help dyslexic children learn the alphabet and numbers. 
The app features several steps to ensure children can understand easily. 
I worked independently on this project, utilizing Android Studio as the development platform.
